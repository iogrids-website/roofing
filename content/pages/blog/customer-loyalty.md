subtitle: The roof on your home is your first line of defense.

The roof on your home or business is the first line of defense when it comes to protecting your real estate property investment! Roofs are generally the most expensive single item that property owners will replace. When it's time to have a new roofing system installed, it is often difficult to know which roofer to hire for the job! Homeowners should be skeptical of hiring their roofer based on price alone. When hiring a roofer, you generally will get exactly what you pay for! Hiring a roofer solely because they provided the lowest bid may result in a poor quality roof that may leak and diminish the curb appeal of your home.

There are numerous roofing contractors in your area. However, not all roofing contractors are experienced in your specific type of roofing system. Residential roofers should be certified with GAF, CertainTeed, Owens Corning, IKO, and Atlas Roofing. A commercial roof contractor should be skilled in all types of flat roofing and certified with various commercial roofing manufacturers such as Carlisle Syntec, Sika Sarnafil, GAF, Versico, and MuleHide. Ask the roofing contractor you are considering if they have experience in installing the exact type of roof that you want installed. Be specific in addressing this question. For instance, if you are interested in installing a metal shake tile roof, ask the roofer if they have actually installed a metal shake tile roof and not just a metal roof. Roofing systems can be very different in their preparation and installation requirements. The same applies for heavy designer shingles, TPO roofs, slate roofs, tile roofs, or any other type of roof. You want to hire a roofer with hands on experience in installing the specific type of roofing system that you want installed on your home or business!
