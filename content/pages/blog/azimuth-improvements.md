A roof has two functions: Insulation and drainage. The insulation protects the house or any establishments not only from the weather, but also from the noise and birds.

The roof serves as the drainage of, for instance, the snow that is accumulated at the top of your roof or maybe the rainfall. Gutters are installed to lead the water caused by rain or melted snow towards the ground so that it will not interrupt with the ventilation of your house. If gutters are not installed, the water may run down the walls of your house or building or may seep inside your property.

The roofing of an establishment varies on different climates and the type of establishment that you have. For commercial establishments, they usually have flat roofs because it is the simplest roof to build; the simpler, the lesser it costs. The hip roof is commonly for residential houses; this roof has four slopes, which could be both square and rectangular in shape. On the other hand, an A-frame roof is commonly used for churches, cottages or other types of homes; this kind of roof serves as the roof and wall for the whole infrastructure. There are so many types of roofs. You can choose any of those for your house, but keep in mind the compatibility of the roof to your house.

Aside from having different types of roofs, the materials used for roofing also varies from the design of the roof and the kind of place that you live in.

Alike other things, the roof of your house or any establishment can also be damaged by certain causes like storms, cyclones, heavy rain and etc. If it is not attended properly, you might as well need to change the materials such as clay tiles, asphalt shingles, concrete tile, metal, slate, wood shingles or any type of roof that you have, and this will need an expensive cost. We want our roofing to last, so here are a few tips on proper installation and maintenance.

*Find the Right Materials*

When getting the right materials for your roof, you should invest on materials which can: last long, protect the house from natural disasters, not too heavy for the roof framing, should complement the style of the house or building and if it is allowed by local building codes.

*Installing the Roof Deck Protection*

It is best if you would hire a roof contractor. You cannot do this process by yourself, you're going to need experienced and trained roof contractors for the proper installation of the roof. The roof deck protection prevents wind-driven rain from getting inside your shelter, another reason why you need it installed is so that your shingles would lay flat and neat.

*Installing Leak Barriers*

Your roof should have a leak barrier especially in the edges where it is prone to leakage. This should be done to reduce the risks of having your roof damaged.

*Installing Shingles*

It is important to nail your shingles in the right angle. Installing the first line of your roof shingles should be done with no error because it serves as the base of the other shingles that are to be installed. It should have a strong base to prevent it from being damaged when a storm comes.

*Installing Flashing*

Flashing is another material to protect the water from seeping into your roof. It is commonly placed on areas where it is prone to leakages like valleys and vent pipe.

When you are busy, you cannot really give time to inspect your roof for damages. When it comes to roof maintenance, you should hire a roof contractor. You can't just climb up to your roof and do the inspection yourself. These trained roof contractors know how to do the job in a proper way. They are provided with safety gears and right materials to determine if your roof has damages or has a potential to breakdown after a storm. With regular care and maintenance, you can save money than letting your roof take the damage, which may be expensive.
