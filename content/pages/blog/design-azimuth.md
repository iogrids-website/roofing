title: Metal or Steel Roofing the Right Choice

Why would anybody in their right mind spend double or even triple the cost of an asphalt roof on a metal roof? On the surface it seems like a waste of money and many asphalt roofing companies are very good at making the case for asphalt. In fact the only logical and valid reason for making the decision to buy an asphalt roof instead of a permanent one is money. If the money is not available and financing is not an option then the initially cheaper asphalt roof will have to suffice. While asphalt roofing is definitely less expensive in the long run it will cost many thousands of dollars more as roof replacements will be needed every 8 to 10 years.

People need to be aware that the insurance industry was burned so badly in recent years because of rapidly deteriorating asphalt shingles that most have set their own standards. Asphalt shingles used to have an asbestos base and a 25 year shingle would last 25 years. Today's asphalt shingles have a fiberglass base and do not stand up to the rigors of Canadian or northern weather. Even 50 year asphalt shingles, which cost a small fortune, on a lower pitched roof 6/12 and under will deteriorate in 8 to 10 years. Unaware of the changes in quality the insurance industry was left holding the bag when water started getting through ruining under laying wood and often home interiors. When they woke up to the fact they introduced requirements for vapor barriers to cover the whole roof prior to installation rather than the three feet of ice and water barrier required by code. Only reputable roofer's adhere to this while the shoddy underbelly continues to do unacceptable and inferior work. Occasionally a person will see a roofing company covering the whole roof with vapor barrier which begs the question why? Why would they go to all of the added expense for no reason?

When looking at the financial choice between asphalt and metal if the comparison is done between a properly done asphalt roof and a high quality metal roof the difference will be about double or a bit more. When doing the math and understanding there is not an asphalt roof that will realistically not last more than 10 years. Some people think they get more life out of their roofs but in reality a 10 year old asphalt roof not only looks terrible but on the south side where the sun bakes it will have deteriorated to the point of compromise. They were sold a 25 or 35 year shingle and didn't read the small print in the warranty which pro-rated it to the point where after 8 years the warranty was virtually worthless.

Most high quality metal roofs come with a 50 year non pro-rated transferable warranty. During the time of the warranty 5 to 6 asphalt roofs would be required. If a metal roof is double the cost then the math would be for example $10,000.00 \[asphalt], and $20,000 \[metal]. Within 10 years a new asphalt roof will be required. $10,000.00 with 3% inflation becomes $13,000.00. Asphalt has now cost $23,000.00 while metal has remained at $20,000.00, except it hasn't. All high quality metal roofs have heat and u.v. reflective coatings meaning they reduce the energy costs because the air conditioner doesn't have to work as hard. These roofs will save as much as 25% on electricity bills. Assuming that $500.00 is save each year over 10 years that would be $5000.00 making the true cost of the metal roof $15,000.00. In ten years the savings are $5000.00 with 40 years left on the non pro-rated warranty. At least four more asphalt roofs will be necessary $13,000.00 turns into $17,000.00, $17,000.00 turns into $21,000.00 etc. all of this money essentially flushed down the toilet. The amount is staggering. The asphalt roofing industry maintains a continual residual income from gullible consumers who choose not to look at the facts.

All of the top metal roofing companies offer financing with open loans which can be paid off without penalty at any time. Some even offer deferred payments allowing 6 to twelve months before the first payment is due. Most of the loans will be over 10 or 15 years creating a small manageable payment usually without down payment. People who choose this option can have a brand new permanent roof without using any of their savings. Asphalt roofing companies on the other hand do not offer financing for the simple truth that the roof will not last as long as the loan.
